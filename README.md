## Features

### 0. Credits
**Bamboo flute**
I want to give credit to [enr1c0wastaken](https://www.reddit.com/user/enr1c0wastaken/) on reddit for coming up with the original idea for these in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/minecraftsuggestions/comments/1gguzjs/bamboo_flutes_revisited_combat_and_music/) post.

Don't worry, he knows i made this and gave me permission

### 1. Strider Boots

**Description:**  
Strider Boots are a unique item that allows players to walk on lava and magma blocks safely. Equip these boots and you can traverse lava lakes and magma blocks without taking damage.

**Usage:**  
- Equip the Strider Boots in the boots slot.
- Walk on lava and magma blocks as if they were solid ground.

### 2. Bamboo Flutes

**Description:**  
Bamboo Flutes are musical instruments that come in various colors. Each flute produces a unique sound when played, adding a musical element to your Minecraft adventures, as well as giving you higher control over your wolves.

**Usage:**  
- The higher you look, the higher the pitch played
- Looking down calls all tamed wolves of the same color as the flute to you
- Looking at a tamed wolf and playing makes it sit/stand
- Looking at any entity that isn't a tamed wolf makes all wolves of the same color as the flute attack it

### 3. Advancements

**Description:**  
The mod includes (for now) two advancements to encourage exploration and use of its features. These advancements include:

- **Strider Approved:** Stand on lava for 60 seconds with Strider Boots equipped.
- **A Beautiful Melody:** Play every type of Bamboo Flute at least once.
